# Fitness Web App
> I have gotten relatively into fitness in the past year, specifically running and weight training, and wanted to work on a project to help solve real problems in my jorney as it isn't something I am naturally good at and want to spend time improving. \
> As of Oct/2024 I finished a month of fat loss aided by my WIP meal planner and am focusing more on muscle gain so I hope to focus efforts on aiding that.
